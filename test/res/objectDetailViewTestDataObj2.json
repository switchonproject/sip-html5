            "description": "\"The geometric corrections are done using the AMORGOS tool (Bourg et al., 2007) provided by ESA and developed by ACRI. AMORGOS gives the geographical location (latitude and longitude) and the altitude for every pixel in the unprojected grid image. Software inputs are the MERIS FRS data, altitude files and operational or precise orbit files. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) used for orthorectification is based on the ACE DEM and is called Getasse 30. The atmospheric correction permits to transform Top of Atmosphere (TOA) radiances into surface reflectances. The effects of Rayleigh and aerosol scattering and gaseous absorption are taken into account. A neural network based on the so-called MOMO method (Fischer and Grassl, 1991) is applied with several inputs. Major input is the aerosol content which is taken from LARS_RR_L3 monthly products for 2009. Ozone is derived from European Climate Meteorological Weather Forecast (ECMWF) data present in the MERIS auxiliary data, O2 and H2O are derived from particular spectral bands plus polynomial coefficients from LUT delivered by ESA (Pelligrini et al., 2004). Two methods are combined to screen clouds, the first one using the MOMO method already quoted, and the second one using thresholds of reflectance on the bands at 443, 753, 760 and 865 nm. From the first method, two output states (clear and cloud) are possible and with the second one, four states can be detected (clear, thin cloud, dense cloud and snow). The final cloud mask merges both results excluding snow and clear states. The “Cloud Top Height” is also estimated for a better determination of cloud shadows and the snow reflectance is kept at its TOA level. The original MERIS level 1B Land/Ocean mask that covers sea, oceans, and the largest in-land lakes is applied and the reflectances are computed only for the unmasked water bodies. Yet, this mask presents some geo-location inaccuracies and is therefore not absolutely correct. In order to take into account these inaccuracies, a Land/Water and Water/Land reclassification is applied to finally generate status “Land”, “Water” or “Flooded” (corresponding to pixels declared wrongly as “Land” before the reclassification). Two methods are combined to reduce the directional effects due to variations of sun and view geometry in the successive measurements of surface reflectances. The Mean Compositing method (Vancutsem et al., 2007) is first processed over a compositing period of reference. This period is of 2 weeks for the internal biweekly composites, of 2 months for the bimonthly composites and of 12 months for the annual composite. An iterative procedure is then applied for detecting “valid” surface reflectance values. Finally, a mean is applied over the “valid” surface spectral reflectances at several temporal frequencies according to the products type. \"",
